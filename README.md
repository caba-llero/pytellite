# Satellite HIL/SIL Simulator â€” Plant MVP

This repository contains the initial Plant (Python) MVP for a modular Satellite HIL/SIL simulator.

## Setup
1. Create a Python 3.10+ environment.
2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Plant
```
python -m plant.plant --config plant/config_default.yaml
```

The Plant emits NDJSON sensor frames (GPS @ 1 Hz, Gyro @ 100 Hz) to UDP `127.0.0.1:10001`, listens for actuator frames on `:10002`, and logs all frames to `logs/replay.ndjson`.

## Tests
Run unit tests:
```
pytest -q
```

## Sample NDJSON
```

```
